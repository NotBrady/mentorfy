# Agent Instructions

**Note:** `CLAUDE.md` is symlinked to this file for Claude Code compatibility.

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

A **work session** is when you are working on one or more **bd** issues. 

**When ending a work session** (ie, when completing the one ore more **bd** issues), you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

# Mentorfy

## Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript (loose - use `any` liberally)
- Tailwind CSS
- framer-motion
- bun

## Conventions
- Use `'use client'` for components with interactivity
- Import paths use `@/` alias
- Inline styles preferred over CSS classes
- framer-motion ease arrays need `as const` for TypeScript
