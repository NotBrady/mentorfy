{"id":"mentorfy-615","title":"Fix Anthropic tool schema error: input_schema.type required","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen the chat API attempts to use tools (showBooking, showCheckout, showVideo), the Anthropic API returns a 400 error:\n\n```\nError [AI_APICallError]: tools.0.custom.input_schema.type: Field required\n```\n\nThe full error response:\n```json\n{\"type\":\"error\",\"error\":{\"type\":\"invalid_request_error\",\"message\":\"tools.0.custom.input_schema.type: Field required\"},\"request_id\":\"req_011CWtsCDBhFQUptcPjSTzyi\"}\n```\n\nThis prevents the AI from using any embed tools even when they are correctly registered.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `ai` SDK's tool definition format doesn't include a top-level `type: 'object'` field that the Anthropic API now requires. When Zod schemas are converted to JSON Schema for the API, the `type` field may be missing at the root level.\n\n## Location\n\n`src/app/api/chat/route.ts` lines 21-73 - the `buildEmbedTools` function\n\n## Current Tool Definition Pattern\n\n```typescript\ntools.showBooking = {\n  description: 'Show booking calendar when user is ready to schedule a call',\n  parameters: z.object({\n    beforeText: z.string().describe('Natural lead-in text before the embed'),\n    afterText: z.string().describe('Follow-up text after the embed'),\n  }),\n  execute: async ({ beforeText, afterText }) =\u003e ({ ... }),\n}\n```\n\n## Likely Solutions (try in order)\n\n### Option 1: Upgrade SDK packages\nCheck if there's a newer version of `@ai-sdk/anthropic` or `ai` that fixes this:\n```bash\nbun update @ai-sdk/anthropic ai\n```\n\n### Option 2: Use zodToJsonSchema explicitly\nThe SDK may need explicit JSON schema conversion. Try wrapping the parameters:\n```typescript\nimport { zodToJsonSchema } from 'zod-to-json-schema'\n\n// In buildEmbedTools:\nconst schema = z.object({\n  beforeText: z.string().describe('...'),\n  afterText: z.string().describe('...'),\n})\n\ntools.showBooking = {\n  description: '...',\n  parameters: zodToJsonSchema(schema),  // Convert explicitly\n  execute: async ({ beforeText, afterText }) =\u003e ({ ... }),\n}\n```\n\n### Option 3: Use tool() helper from ai SDK\nThe `ai` SDK has a `tool()` helper that may handle schema conversion correctly:\n```typescript\nimport { tool } from 'ai'\n\ntools.showBooking = tool({\n  description: '...',\n  parameters: z.object({ ... }),\n  execute: async ({ beforeText, afterText }) =\u003e ({ ... }),\n})\n```\n\n### Option 4: Manual JSON Schema with type field\nIf all else fails, define the schema manually:\n```typescript\ntools.showBooking = {\n  description: '...',\n  parameters: {\n    type: 'object',  // \u003c-- This is what Anthropic requires\n    properties: {\n      beforeText: { type: 'string', description: '...' },\n      afterText: { type: 'string', description: '...' },\n    },\n    required: ['beforeText', 'afterText'],\n  },\n  execute: async ({ beforeText, afterText }) =\u003e ({ ... }),\n}\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Start the dev server: `bun run dev`\n2. Set up a session with completedPhases including phase 4 (so booking tool is registered)\n3. Send a chat message asking to book a call\n4. Check server logs - should see the tool being called without the schema error\n5. The Calendly embed should appear in the chat\n\n## References\n\n- Anthropic tool use docs: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use\n- Vercel AI SDK tools: https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling\n- Related error discussions: search GitHub issues for 'input_schema.type required'","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-07T15:22:31.868762-08:00","created_by":"elijah","updated_at":"2026-01-07T16:13:45.466701-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T16:13:45.466701-08:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
