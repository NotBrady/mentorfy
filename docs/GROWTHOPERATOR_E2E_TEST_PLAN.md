# Growth Operator Flow - End-to-End Test Plan

**Purpose:** Systematic testing of the complete Growth Operator assessment journey using Playwright MCP.

**CRITICAL:** Abort on first failure. Do not continue past any failed assertion - the flow is sequential and later tests depend on earlier state.

---

## Pre-Test Setup

### 1. Start Fresh Dev Server
```bash
bun dev
```
Wait for server to be ready on `localhost:3000`.

### 2. Clear All State
Navigate to `localhost:3000/growthoperator` and execute in browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
```
Refresh the page.

---

## Test Execution

Click continue/submit.

---

#### Step 11 - Final AI Diagnosis Moment (CRITICAL)

**Assert:** AI response appears (should make a qualification decision based on ALL answers).

**Assert:** Response should:
1. Reflect their situation with depth (pull from "what's going on" answer)
2. Connect to the opportunity (pull from "why this" answer)
3. Provide honest assessment of fit (pull from "why you" answer)
4. Make a clear decision

**CONDITIONAL BEHAVIOR - Two possible outcomes:**

##### Outcome A: Qualified (Expected with test data above)

**Assert:** Calendly booking widget is embedded inline with the diagnosis.
**Assert:** Booking widget URL: `https://calendly.com/brady-mentorfy/30min`
**Assert:** The diagnosis text appears ABOVE the calendar embed (via `beforeText`).
**Assert:** Optional follow-up text may appear below the calendar.

##### Outcome B: Not Qualified

**Assert:** No Calendly booking widget appears.
**Assert:** AI provides honest, kind explanation of why it's not the right timing.
**Assert:** Continue button is visible to exit the flow.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Qualified Applicant (Happy Path)

Use test data that meets qualification criteria:
- **Time:** 10-20 hours or 20+ hours (10+ hours/week)
- **Capital:** $5,000 - $10,000 or $10,000+ ($5k+ capital)
- **Experience:** Any relevant background
- **Open answers:** Thoughtful, specific responses

**Expected Result:** Calendly widget appears in final diagnosis.

---

### Scenario 2: Unqualified - Insufficient Time

Use test data with disqualifying time commitment:
- **Time:** Less than 5 hours

**Expected Result:** No Calendly widget. Kind rejection message.

---

### Scenario 3: Unqualified - Insufficient Capital

Use test data with disqualifying capital:
- **Capital:** Under $1,000

**Expected Result:** No Calendly widget. Kind rejection message.

---

### Scenario 4: Unqualified - Vague Answers

Use test data with qualification-level MC answers but:
- **Open answers:** Very short, vague, or low-effort responses like "idk" or "money"

**Expected Result:** No Calendly widget. Feedback about needing more thoughtful engagement.

---

## Test Complete

If all assertions pass for Scenario 1 (Happy Path), the Growth Operator flow is working correctly.

---

## Issue Reporting Format

```
## FAILED: [Step X or Scenario Y]
